dgVoice is a [Go](https://golang.org/) package that provides an example of 
adding opus audio and play file support for [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo).

* You must use the current develop branch of Discordgo
* You must have ffmpeg in your path and Opus libs already installed.

**This fork also has the ability to decode MP3s internally.**

This code should be considered just a proof of concept, or an example, of 
accomplishing this task and not a defacto standard. 

Please send feedback on any performance improvements that can be made for 
sound quality, stability, or efficiency.
